        This is my repository for practicing SQL using websites like 
        <a href="https://datalemur.com/">DataLemur</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>, 
        <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>, and others. 
        I use these websites as sources for practicing <strong>problem-solving</strong> 
        questions to improve my SQL skills. Here, I document SQL queries and their 
        results for my personal learning reference.
