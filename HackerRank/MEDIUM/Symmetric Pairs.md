Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

## SOLUTION :
```SQL
SELECT F1.X, F1.Y 
FROM FUNCTIONS F1
JOIN FUNCTIONS F2
     ON F1.X = F2.Y AND F1.Y = F2.X 
WHERE F1.X < F1.Y

UNION

SELECT X, Y 
FROM FUNCTIONS
WHERE X = Y 
GROUP BY X, Y 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY X, Y;
